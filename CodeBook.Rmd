This code book describes the variables used 

**Tidy_Data.txt**

**data_dir**:           character, holds the directory path of the data (UCI HAR Dataset)  
**test_dir**:           character, holds the directory path of the test data set  
**train_dir**:          character, holds the directory path of the test data set  
**old.wd**:             character, holds the directory path of the working directory when the script was called, so it can be reset on exit    

**x_train**:            initially holds the x_train.txt data set, it is morphed as the script runs through cleaning, adding activity_code and subject data (see below) before it is merged with x_test  
**x_test**:             initially holds the x_test.txt data set, it is morphed as the script runs through cleaning, adding activity_code and subject data (see below) before it is merged with x_train  
**old_x_names**:        temporary vector, holds the names used in x_train and x_test  
**features**:           temporary_vector, holds the values stored in features.txt and used to rename the measurement columns in x_test and x_train, features contains a list of measurement names of all measures made in the x_train and x_test data sets, this vector is tidied up in the script to make it suitable for use as a column name before it is applied: "()" are removed, "," is replaced with "_", and "-" is replaced with "_"  

**activity_code**:      
**y_train**:
**y_train_activities**:
**y_test**:
**y_test_activities**:

**subject_train**:
**subject_test**:
**subjects**:

**cols**:
**cols_upp**:
**keep**:
**observation_number**:
**x_data_melt**:
