# Variables Used in the Script
**data_dir**:           character, holds the directory path of the data (UCI HAR Dataset)  
**test_dir**:           character, holds the directory path of the test data set  
**train_dir**:          character, holds the directory path of the test data set  
**old.wd**:             character, holds the directory path of the working directory when the script was called, so it can be reset on exit    

**x_train**:            data frame, initially holds the x_train.txt data set, it is morphed as the script runs through cleaning, adding activity_code and subject data (see below) before it is merged with x_test  
**x_test**:             data frame, initially holds the x_test.txt data set, it is morphed as the script runs through cleaning, adding activity_code and subject data (see below) before it is merged with x_train  
**old_x_names**:        character vector, temporary, holds the names used in x_train and x_test  
**features**:           character vector, temporary, holds the values stored in features.txt and used to rename the measurement columns in x_test and x_train, features contains a list of measurement names of all measures made in the x_train and x_test data sets, this vector is tidied up in the script to make it suitable for use as a column name before it is applied: "()" are removed, "," is replaced with "_", and "-" is replaced with "_"  

**activity_code**:      character vector, temporary, holds lookup values of the six activity descriptions  
**y_train**:            data frame, used to hold the y_train.txt file data, there is one row in y_train corresponding to each row in x_train  
**y_train_activities**: character vector, holds the result of y_train converted from integers 1:6 to character values held in activity_code, values 1 are replaced with "WALKING", etc.
**y_test**:             data frame, used to hold the y_train.txt file data, there is one row in y_test corresponding to each row in x_test
**y_test_activities**:  character vector, holds the result of y_test converted from integers 1:6 to character values held in activity_code, values 1 are replaced with "WALKING", etc.

**subject_train**:      
**subject_test**:
**subjects**:

**cols**:
**cols_upp**:
**keep**:
**observation_number**:
**x_data_melt**:
**x_data_tidy**:
